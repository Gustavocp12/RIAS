RIAS - Self-Supervised Intelligent Networks

Welcome to the RIAS (Self-Supervised Intelligent Networks) project. RIAS is an advanced artificial intelligence system composed of multiple neural networks collaborating to autonomously evaluate and validate information. Each neural network has its own “opinion” or interpretation of the data, allowing for more robust and well-founded analysis.

Overview

The goal of RIAS is to create an AI system that can:

	•	Continuous Learning: Learn continuously from new data.
	•	Information Validation: Use a dedicated network to classify and validate evidence.
	•	Autonomous Adaptation: Evolve and adjust based on verifiable data.
	•	Reliable Decision-Making: Provide decisions based on well-founded analyses.

Key Features

	•	Ensemble of Neural Networks: Combination of multiple models to improve accuracy.
	•	Self-Supervision: Ability of neural networks to self-evaluate and correct.
	•	Adaptability: Automatic adjustment to different types of data and contexts.
	•	Transparency: Clear and traceable decision-making processes.
